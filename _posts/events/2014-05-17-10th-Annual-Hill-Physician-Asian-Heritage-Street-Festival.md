### Faces of Asia Cultural Procession

The Faces of Asia Cultural Procession is a grand element of the street celebration comprising of more than 20 bay area organizations parading through the festival dressed in cultural attire. The purpose of the procession is to expose the raw beauty and traditional significance of the Asian identities that represent the people of the SF Bay Area. Because the procession was so successful previous years, participants will be able to win cash prizes and trophies again this year in the four categories:

- Largest Contingent (based purely upon number of participants)
- Most Colorful Contingent
- Most Spirited Contingent
