Event details: The Lunar New Year festival is based on the Lunar Calendar that many Eastern countries have followed in the past, where the New Year begins in February. This is different than the modern Western calendar where the New Year begins on January 1st.

In a traditional sense, the festival is a time to honor ancestors and deities, as well as an intimate time for families to spend time together. It is tradition for families to clean the house before New Year day, as a means to sweep away bad-fortune for the New Year. Houses will also be decorated with themes of red, which signify prosperity and good luck. Another major activity that happens during the Lunar New Year festival is the passing of money through red paper envelopes given to younger generations. 

The event is one of the largest ethnic street festivals held each year in the San Francisco Bay Area. With so many participants from all over the bay area, a four-block area is designated for children and adult to walk through and participate with different activities and food vendors. Cultural performances are held all day to entertain those who want to enjoy music and arts with their friends and family. There are various fun games and activities for children to enjoy and learn about the Lunar New Year.
