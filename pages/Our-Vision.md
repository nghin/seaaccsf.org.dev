SEAACC’s vision stems from the 3 P’s:

- <strong>Preserve</strong> – Embrace and cultivate the historical impact that arts and culture has provided within the Southeast Asian community.
- <strong>Promote</strong> – We believe that cultural advancement and ethnic identity comes from an awareness of how one’s roots play a significant role in community development. 
- <strong>Practice</strong> – Education and theory is useless without application. Different cultural and social activities are held in the San Francisco Bay Area so that anyone and everyone can be involved and engaged within the community.
